# Building-a-Decision-Tree-Classifier-from-Scratch-for-Health-Data
This is a project I developed to implement a custom decision tree classifier for predicting diagnoses based on patient data. I created the decision tree from scratch, using Gini impurity and entropy to split the dataset recursively, without relying on existing Python libraries.
